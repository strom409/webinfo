                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Two years ago, I experienced a profound heartbreak that changed me forever. I gave my heart completely to someone I thought was my forever, only to discover their betrayal. The pain was overwhelming, and I spent four long months in tears, questioning everything about love and trust.</p>
                    <p>This experience, though painful, taught me valuable lessons about self-worth and resilience. It showed me that even in our darkest moments, we can find strength we never knew we had. The journey through heartbreak has made me stronger and more cautious about who I let into my heart.</p>
                    <p>Today, I carry these lessons with me, not as scars, but as reminders of my capacity to heal and grow. This experience has shaped me into someone who values genuine connections and understands the importance of self-love first.</p>
