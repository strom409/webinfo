            <h2>🌟 How We First Met 🌟</h2>
            <p>It all began with a voice — your voice, Uzma. A casual Clubhouse room turned into a magical 4-hour talk that made me feel like we knew each other forever.</p>
            <p>We laughed, we connected, and soon we exchanged social media — Instagram and LinkedIn. That wasn't enough; we shared our numbers too.</p>
            <p>Then came the twist — you blocked me. It hurt. But just after two days, you reappeared with a new ID. I recognized your voice instantly. How could I not?</p>
            <p>That moment made me realize — some connections are destined. Our bond wasn't just random; it was written in the stars.</p>

        <div id="story2">
            <h2>💫 About You, Uzma 💫</h2>
            <p>You've completed B.Tech in Computer Science, and now you're working — smart, independent, and unstoppable.</p>
            <p>But there's more to you than your success. You have a fire in you — sometimes angry, sometimes silent — but always real.</p>
            <p>Your beauty isn't just in your face, it's in the way your eyes speak — like they're carrying stories I want to listen to forever.</p>
            <p>You're rare, Uzma. And everything about you makes me feel lucky just to know you.</p>

Uzma, every day since we've spoken, you've lived in my thoughts.
Your smile is etched in my mind like a favorite melody.
I admire your strength, your spark, and your untold dreams.
Your silence speaks louder than words, and I understand every pause.
I don't just like you — I admire you, I respect you, and yes, I love you.
With every moment, I wish to stand beside you — in happiness, in pain, in growth.
I want to be your calm when life gets loud.
Will you be mine?`;

I admire the way you carry yourself with grace and pride.
From Clubhouse to chats, from laughs to silence — everything has meaning.
And if being your friend is my destiny, I'll wear it proudly.
I'll always be there — cheering you on quietly or walking beside you silently.
In you, I found someone I can trust, respect, and support.
Friendship is not less; it is powerful and pure.
I'll remember your stories, your eyes, and the way you made me feel.
You'll always be my favorite person, no matter what.
